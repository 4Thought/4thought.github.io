          <h2>Customer</h2>
          <p>
            TLW Capital Management (TLW) is a hedge fund that specializes in
            trading currencies and commodities. The firm's founder and Chief
            Investment Officer Troy Wilson has spent over a decade developing a
            systematic method of trading that leverages advanced Forex
            strategies to increase profits and reduce risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            TLW has used off-the-shelf technology platforms like TradingViewand
            QuantConnectto help chart, model, and backtest various
            strategies. Many aspects of its systematic trading method, however,
            have remained manual or have required manually inputting extensive
            code to run. The firm ultimately desires to have a fully autonomous
            trading system
          </p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            TLW faced several significant challenges related to implementing
            their advanced Forex strategies. The most urgent of these pain
            points involve improving the speed of their decision-making which
            has a direct and substantial impact on revenue.

            With the above emphasis on swift decision-making, TLW required a
            solution that effectively addresses four key pain points.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Building and testing trading algorithms manually</strong>
              are time-consuming and resource-intensive endeavors. These
              inefficiencies hinder TLW's ability to respond quickly to market
              changes and optimize their trading strategies.

                at trading-related decisions quickly</strong
              >
              often results in missed opportunities that have a significant
              negative impact on top-line revenue. This especially is the case
              in fast-paced Forex markets.

              >
              significantly degrades the reliability of their backtesting and
              strategy development. The lack of an efficient data management
              system has posed risks to the reliability and effectiveness of
              TLW's trading models.

              to build and support a custom, state-of-the-art algorithmic

            In addition to addressing TLW's above four pain points, this

            Forex trading platform.

            Of note here were TLW's concerns related to the accuracy and
            efficient processing of data, which were especially important given
            the widely known shortfall of AI platforms to meet the rigors of
            institutional finance. These concerns dissipated when TLW learned
            that 4Thought's unique platform infrastructure restricts the AI to
            run in a custom environment built for finance which validates all AI
            output against trusted data sources.

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>
            The implementation of the 4Thought Platform is having a
            transformative impact on TLW's operations, mostly by improving the
            speed of their decision-making. By being able to enter trades just a
            few minutes earlier, TLW can capitalize on market opportunities that
            they otherwise would have missed. This ability to act quickly with
            confidence gives TLW a competitive edge in fast-paced Forex trading
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, implementing the 4Thought Platform has led to the
            following key changes at TLW.
          </p>
          <ol style="margin: 0">
            <li>
              <strong>By automating the firm's manual processes</strong>, the
              platform significantly reduces the time that TLW's staff spends on
              chart analysis and coding. The firm can now reallocate this time
              to higher value tasks like developing new algorithms that optimize
              its strategies in real-time in response to market changes.

                >By providing a highly flexible and easy-to-use technology
                system</strong
              >, the 4Thought Platform enables TLW to add custom features that
              improve their trading methods and workflows to an extent that was
              not possible with their prior setup of various off-the-shelf
              platforms. For example, TLW has added custom data sources and
              internal tools that enhance their trading strategies and reduce
              the risk of human error. (See images of platform and custom tool.)

              >, the 4Thought Platform empowers TLW to establish a growing
              integrated system of risk controls that adapt quickly to
              real-world changes. This major shift away from constant manual
              monitoring of markets to more systematic management of market risk
              leads to greater confidence in the ongoing stability of TLW's
              performance by the firm's constituents, including LP investors.

            primarily by significantly increasing the speed of decision-making
